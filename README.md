## Installation

npm is the package management system for this project.

1. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory

   ```js
   # Set to production when deploying to production
   NODE_ENV=development

   # Database URL
   DATABASE_URL=<YOUR_DATABASE_URL>
   
   # Apollo Graphql client server URI
   APOLLO_URI=<YOUR_APOLLO_URI>

   # Firebase Variables
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=<YOUR_DOMAIN>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=<YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=<YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=<YOUR_APP_ID>

   # Google Places API
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY=<YOUR_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY>
   ```

3. Run production client

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

## Using the app in development mode

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Firebase Authentication set-up
You will need a firebase account to get started.
Create a project, and an application for the project.

Once you have your keys, add them to the `.env` file in the root directory. You will need these to initialize firebase.

In `Next.js`, the convention for naming environment variables is that they have to start with NEXT_PUBLIC.

The app is currently set up to use Google/Facebook/Github authentication. You will need to activate those sign-in methods on firebase or remove the sign-in components you do not wish to use from `pages/login/index.js`.

## Google Maps API set-up

- You will need a Google Maps API key to get started.
- You can create a key here: https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/start
- Click on the credentials tab on the left side of the page
- Click on the Create Credentials button at the top of the page and follow the instructions

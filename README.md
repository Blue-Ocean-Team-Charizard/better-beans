This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Firebase Authentication set-up
You will need a firebase account to get started. 
Create a project, and an application for the project.

Once you have your keys, add them to a global .env file. You will need these to initialize firebase.
In Next.js, the convention for naming environment variables is that they have to start with NEXT_PUBLIC.
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PUBLIC_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=<YOUR_DOMAIN>
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
```

The app is currently set up to use Google/Facebook/Github authentication. You will need to activate those sign-in methods on firebase or remove the sign-in components you do not wish to use from pages/login/index.js.
